## Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to get this project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Set up environment

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Install uv
pip install uv

# Install development dependencies
./requirements/install.sh dev

# Or for production
./requirements/install.sh prod
```

See `requirements/README.md` for more details on using uv.

### 3. Configure local settings

```bash
# Copy the local settings template
cp settings/local_template.py settings/local.py

# Copy the environment variables example file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local:
# - Add your secure SECRET_KEY (50 characters)
# - Configure your PostgreSQL database settings
# - Add API keys and other sensitive information
```

### 4. Set up the database

```bash
# Create a PostgreSQL database
createdb your_database_name  # Or use your preferred PostgreSQL client

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a superuser and run server

```bash
# Create admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver
```

### Alternative: Using Docker

If you prefer to use Docker for development:

```bash
# Create a .env.local file from the example
cp .env.example .env.local

# Build and start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# Create a superuser
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your Docker-based application running.

### Running Tests

Run Django-integrated tests with:

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific app tests
python manage.py test apps.common.tests

# Run specific test case
python manage.py test apps.common.tests.test_behaviors.test_timestampable

# Run standalone behavior mixin tests (no Django setup required)
python test_behaviors.py
```

For Python 3.12 compatibility, use the standalone test script when working with behavior mixins.

### Deployment

For deployments to platforms like Render or Heroku:

```bash
# Generate the requirements.txt file needed for deployment
./requirements/generate_deployment_requirements.sh

# This will create a requirements.txt file in the project root 
# which can be used by deployment platforms
```


# Project Structure

This project is structured in a modular fashion to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. Below is the directory structure along with descriptions for each major module:

## Template Pattern

This project uses standard Django templates with the following patterns:

- **Template Inheritance**: Base templates define common layout and blocks that are extended by page templates.
- **Template Includes**: Reusable UI elements are created as separate template files and included using `{% include %}`.
- **Context Processors**: Custom context data for templates is generated by functions in `apps/public/views/components/`.
- **HTMX Integration**: HTMX is used for interactive elements, with partial updates handled by dedicated views.

Templates are primarily stored in two locations:
- `/templates`: Global templates used across multiple apps
- `/apps/public/templates`: Public frontend templates

- `apps/`: Contains all applications that make up the project.
- `settings/`: Configuration settings for the entire Django project.
- `static/`: Global static files such as CSS, JS, and images.
- `templates/`: Global HTML templates.
- `build.sh`: Build script for Render deployment
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
- `runtime.txt`: Specifies the Python runtime.

### API

_Defines the application programming interface (API) layer, responsible for handling all the RESTful requests._

- `apps/api/`: api app 
  - `serializers/`: Contains serializer classes for converting complex data types to JSON.
  - `tests/`: Holds test cases for the API application.
  - `views/`: Contains views that manage the logic and control flow for API requests.
  - `urls.py`: URL declarations for API routes. 

### Common

_General purpose and shared components for any applications. 
This includes models, forms, views, and other components that are shared across multiple apps._

_Key Features include 1. Enhanced User model with best practices for consumer-facing apps. 2. Common model behaviors like timestamping, authoring, etc. 3. Large collection of utility functions for common problems encountered while building applications._

#### Behavior Mixins

The `apps/common/behaviors/` directory contains reusable model mixins that add common functionality:

- **Timestampable**: Adds `created_at` and `modified_at` fields with automatic updates
- **Authorable**: Tracks content authors with anonymous option
- **Publishable**: Manages content publishing workflow with publish/unpublish functionality
- **Expirable**: Handles content expiration with validity tracking
- **Permalinkable**: Manages URL slugs and permalink generation
- **Locatable**: Adds location data with address and coordinate fields
- **Annotatable**: Provides notes relationship management

All behavior mixins have comprehensive test coverage (see `apps/common/tests/test_behaviors/`).


- `apps/common/`: common app
  - `behaviors/`: Common model behaviors like timestamping.
  - `forms/`: Shared form definitions.
  - `migrations/`: Database migration scripts for common models.
  - `models/`: General purpose model definitions.
  - `serializers/`: Common serializer classes.
  - `tests/`: Tests for common functionality.
  - `utilities/`: Helper functions and classes.
  - `views/`: Shared views.
  - `admin.py`: Admin interface configurations.

### Communication

_Contains all communication-related modules and integration-specific logic. 
Each type of communication has a model: SMS, Email, etc_

- `apps/communication/`: communication app 
  - `forms/`: Form definitions for the communication app.
  - `migrations/`: Migration scripts for communication-related models.
  - `models/`: Data models specific to communication.
  - `static/`: Static files for the communication module.
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for the communication module.
  - `tests/`: Tests for communication features.
  - `views/`: Views handling communication flows.
  - `admin.py`: Admin configurations for communication.
  - `apps.py`: Application settings for communication.
  - `urls.py`: URL patterns for communication features.

### Integration

_Contains all integration-specific logic and modules. Each integration is a separate module within this directory.
Keep all integration-specific logic within the integration definitions here.
When 3rd party APIs or SD are updated, the integration modules should be updated accordingly.
Define your own interface methods for each integration module and call them from the other apps._

- `apps/integration/`: Integrations with external services.
  - `slack/`: Slack integration components.
  - `telegram/`: Telegram bot components.

### Public

_Contains all modules and logic to power UI served by this system. This includes the websites, landing pages, and any other public-facing components.
Remove this app if you don't need a public-facing website. Note this is separate from the built-in Django admin interface._

- `apps/public/`: Public-facing components of the project.
  - `components/`: Reusable components for the frontend.
  - `middleware/`: Middleware for handling requests/responses.
  - `static/`: Static assets for the public module.
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for the public views.
  - `views/`: Views serving the public-facing parts of the project.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the public module.
  - `urls.py`: URL patterns for the public section.
