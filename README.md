## Setup and Documentation

### Getting Started
- **Quick Start**: Run `source setup_local_env.sh` for automated local environment setup with activated virtual environment
- **Code Quality**: Run `uv run pre-commit install` to set up automatic code quality checks
- For detailed setup instructions, see [Setup Guide](docs/guides/SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- For contribution guidelines, see [Contributing Guide](docs/guides/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- For enhancement roadmap, see [TODO List](docs/TODO.md)
- For development practices, see [Development Guide](CLAUDE.md)

### Documentation
- **API and Code Documentation**: [API and Code Documentation](https://tomcounsell.github.io/django-project-template/) (generated with Sphinx and hosted on GitHub Pages)
- Documentation is automatically built and published from the main branch

### Coding Standards & Quality

#### Automated Code Quality
This project uses **pre-commit hooks** to maintain code quality:
- **Automatic formatting** with Black and isort
- **Linting** with Flake8 and Django-specific plugins
- **Security scanning** with Bandit
- **Django checks** before every commit

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (required for all contributors)
uv run pre-commit install

# Run manually on all files
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

See [CI/CD Guide](docs/guides/CICD.md) for complete pre-commit documentation.

# Project Structure

This project is structured in a modular fashion to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. Below is the directory structure along with descriptions for each major module:

## Template Pattern

This project uses standard Django templates with the following patterns:

- **Template Inheritance**: Base templates define common layout and blocks that are extended by page templates.
- **Template Includes**: Reusable UI elements are created as separate template files and included using `{% include %}`.
- **Context Processors**: Custom context data for templates is generated by functions in `apps/public/views/components/`.
- **HTMX Integration**: HTMX is used for interactive elements, with partial updates handled by dedicated views.

Templates are stored in a single location:
- `apps/public/templates`: All HTML templates for the project

For detailed template conventions, naming patterns, and best practices, see [Template Conventions](docs/TEMPLATE_CONVENTIONS.md).

## Testing

This project follows a comprehensive testing approach with 100% test coverage for core components:

- **Testing Framework**: pytest with pytest-django
- **Test Organization**:
  - Model tests: `apps/{app_name}/tests/test_models/`
  - View tests: `apps/{app_name}/tests/test_views/`
  - Behavior tests: `apps/common/tests/test_behaviors.py` and standalone tests
  - Integration tests: `apps/{app_name}/tests/test_*.py`
- **Test Coverage**: 100% for behavior mixins and core models

Running tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings pytest

# Run with coverage
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings pytest --cov=apps

# Run specific test modules
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings pytest apps/common/tests/test_behaviors.py
```

For detailed testing conventions and practices, see [Test Conventions](docs/advanced/TEST_CONVENTIONS.md).

- `apps/`: Contains all applications that make up the project.
- `settings/`: Configuration settings for the entire Django project.
- `static/`: All static files (CSS, JS, images) for the project. No app-specific static directories.
- `build.sh`: Build script for Render deployment
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
- `runtime.txt`: Specifies the Python runtime.

### API

_Defines the application programming interface (API) layer, responsible for handling all the RESTful requests._

- `apps/api/`: api app 
  - `serializers/`: Contains serializer classes for converting complex data types to JSON.
  - `tests/`: Holds test cases for the API application.
  - `views/`: Contains views that manage the logic and control flow for API requests.
  - `urls.py`: URL declarations for API routes. 

### Common

_General purpose and shared components for any applications. 
This includes models, forms, views, and other components that are shared across multiple apps._

_Key Features include 1. Enhanced User model with best practices for consumer-facing apps. 2. Common model behaviors like timestamping, authoring, etc. 3. Large collection of utility functions for common problems encountered while building applications. 4. Communication-related models (SMS, Email) for handling notifications and messaging._

#### Behavior Mixins

The `apps/common/behaviors/` directory contains reusable model mixins that add common functionality:

- **Timestampable**: Adds `created_at` and `modified_at` fields with automatic updates
- **Authorable**: Tracks content authors with anonymous option
- **Publishable**: Manages content publishing workflow with publish/unpublish functionality
- **Expirable**: Handles content expiration with validity tracking
- **Permalinkable**: Manages URL slugs and permalink generation
- **Locatable**: Adds location data with address and coordinate fields
- **Annotatable**: Provides notes relationship management

All behavior mixins have 100% test coverage (see `apps/common/tests/test_behaviors.py` and standalone tests in `apps/common/behaviors/tests/test_behaviors.py` for Python 3.12 compatibility).


- `apps/common/`: common app
  - `behaviors/`: Common model behaviors like timestamping.
  - `forms/`: Shared form definitions.
  - `migrations/`: Database migration scripts for common models.
  - `models/`: General purpose model definitions including communication models (Email, SMS).
  - `serializers/`: Common serializer classes.
  - `tests/`: Tests for common functionality.
  - `utilities/`: Helper functions and classes.
  - `views/`: Shared views.
  - `admin.py`: Admin interface configurations.

### Integration

_Contains all integration-specific logic and modules. Each integration is a separate module within this directory.
Keep all integration-specific logic within the integration definitions here.
When 3rd party APIs or SD are updated, the integration modules should be updated accordingly.
Define your own interface methods for each integration module and call them from the other apps._

- `apps/integration/`: Integrations with external services.
  - `slack/`: Slack integration components.
  - `telegram/`: Telegram bot components.

### Public

_Contains all modules and logic to power UI served by this system. This includes the websites, landing pages, and any other public-facing components.
Remove this app if you don't need a public-facing website. Note this is separate from the built-in Django admin interface._

- `apps/public/`: Public-facing components of the project.
  - `components/`: Reusable components for the frontend.
  - `middleware/`: Middleware for handling requests/responses.
  - `static/`: Static assets for the public module.
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for the public views.
  - `views/`: Views serving the public-facing parts of the project.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the public module.
  - `urls.py`: URL patterns for the public section.
