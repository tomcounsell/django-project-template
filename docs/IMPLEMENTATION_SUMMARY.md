   - Registered the model in the admin interface with appropriate display fields and filtering

2. **Created Detailed Setup Guide for New Developers**
   - Documented step-by-step setup process with explanations
   - Included common development tasks and troubleshooting tips
   - Provided an overview of the project structure and architecture
   - Added guidance for testing, migrations, and code formatting

3. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Created a dedicated behavior mixins guide with examples
   - Added documentation on best practices for creating new mixins
   - Improved existing documentation by adding practical examples
   - Updated TODO list to reflect completed tasks

## Implementation Details

### BlogPost Model
The `BlogPost` model demonstrates the power of behavior mixins by combining:
- `Timestampable`: Tracks creation and modification dates
- `Authorable`: Associates posts with authors and handles anonymous posting
- `Publishable`: Manages publishing workflow with timestamps
- `Expirable`: Allows posts to expire after a certain date
- `Locatable`: Associates posts with geographic locations
- `Permalinkable`: Provides SEO-friendly URLs via slugs
- `Annotatable`: Allows attaching notes to posts

This model serves as both a practical example and a template for future development.

### Testing
Following the project's TDD approach:
- Created comprehensive tests for the BlogPost model
- Verified the functionality of each behavior mixin
- Used Django's testing framework for consistency
- Ensured all model properties and methods are tested

### Forms and Admin
- Separated form logic from model definition following best practices
- Created a properly-structured form with validation
- Implemented a feature-rich admin interface with custom display methods
- Used appropriate field organization and filtering

### Migration
Added a new migration file (0003_blogpost.py) to support the BlogPost model, maintaining database compatibility.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Run the complete test suite to verify implementation
   - Check test coverage to ensure comprehensive test coverage
   - Run migration tests on different database configurations

2. **Documentation**
   - Continue improving documentation for remaining items in TODO.md
   - Add more practical examples and use cases
   - Consider creating video or interactive tutorials

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Implement views and templates for the BlogPost model
   - Add HTMX integration for interactive features
   - Create example API endpoints for the model
