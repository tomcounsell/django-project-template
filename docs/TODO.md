# TODO List for Django Project Template

## Current System Architecture

This project follows a clean architecture with:
- Root-level template and static directories (no app-specific templates)
- Behavior mixins for reusable model functionality
- HTMX-centric frontend development with minimal JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling through django-tailwind
- Core apps: common, api, public, ai, integration

## Completed Features ✅
