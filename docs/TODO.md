# TODO List for Django Project Template

## Test Suite Fixes 🛠️ (URGENT)

We've made significant progress in fixing the test suite:

### Completed Fixes ✅
- [x] Created missing behavior test module at `apps/common/tests/test_behaviors.py`
- [x] Fixed syntax error in `apps/public/tests/test_htmx_interactions.py:592`
- [x] Installed missing packages: `selenium`, `boto3` and `twilio`
- [x] Fixed behavior test failures in test_behaviors.py (all tests now pass)
- [x] Fixed some Twilio integration tests (debug mode tests now pass)
- [x] Fixed User model tests by adding back payment-related fields with proper migration plan
- [x] Fixed Stripe-related tests by updating model references (all User model tests now pass)
- [x] Enhanced User model test coverage to 100% with complete tests for all properties and methods
- [x] Created comprehensive test troubleshooting guide (docs/TEST_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- [x] Improved test documentation with best practices for running tests and fixing common issues

### Remaining Test Structure Issues
- [ ] Fix Twilio live mode integration tests (patching TwilioRestClient correctly)
- [ ] Fix AWS S3 integration tests (proper mocking)
- [ ] Refactor test classes with constructors to use `setUp()` instead of `__init__()`
- [ ] Fix Loops and Stripe integration test mocks

### Implementation Issues
- [x] Fix User model tests (added back payment-related fields and fixed related test implementation)
- [ ] Fix remaining model test failures (address, image, note, etc. - need to fix model implementations)
- [ ] Complete browser testing infrastructure (adapt to current Playwright/Selenium setup)
- [ ] Fix E2E test framework (Django LiveServerTestCase compatibility)

### Test Statistics
- Total tests: 444 tests
- Currently passing: 289 tests (65%)
- Progress: Fixed critical path for running most tests

**Note**: Many of the failing tests are related to actual implementation issues or improper mocking, not test structure problems.

## API Cleanup ✅

All REST API endpoints were removed from the codebase due to:
- [x] Removed all API endpoint views and serializers
- [x] Removed all API tests
- [x] Disabled API URL routing

For a future API implementation:
1. Build a proper API foundation with strong authentication
2. Implement robust serializers with validation
3. Use proper ViewSets with comprehensive test coverage
4. Add proper rate limiting and throttling

## Current System Architecture

This project follows a clean architecture with:
- Root-level template and static directories (no app-specific templates)
- Behavior mixins for reusable model functionality
- HTMX-centric frontend development with minimal JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling through django-tailwind
- Core apps: common, api, public, ai, integration

## Completed Features Summary ✅

- **Architecture & Core:** Behavior mixins, consolidated templates, comprehensive testing, type annotations, uv for dependencies, admin dashboard, error handling, validation
- **Team Management:** Single-team interface with admin-only creation, conditional UI based on team membership
- **API & Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger, API key authentication, comprehensive endpoint tests, response pagination
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, E2E, and visual tests; test management system; HTMX interaction tests; responsive design tests
- **Integrations:** Loops email, Stripe payments, Twilio SMS, AWS S3 storage
- **DevOps:** CI/CD workflows, Render deployment configuration, uvicorn ASGI worker
- **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, improved navigation, responsive layouts, frontend component tests

## Pending Tasks 📋
