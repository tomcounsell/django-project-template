{# 
  _partial_base.html - Base template for HTMX partial components
  ============================================================
  
  Purpose:
  This is the base template for all HTMX partial components, providing common 
  structure and blocks. It does not include HTML, HEAD, or BODY tags since
  it's meant for fragments loaded via HTMX.
  
  Structure:
  - Root element: Contains the main content
  - Optional CSS classes: Apply styling as needed
  
  Usage:
  {% extends "partials/_partial_base.html" %}
  {% block content %}
    <!-- Component-specific content here -->
  {% endblock content %}
  
  Notes:
  - Partials should NOT include layout elements like navigation or footers
  - Each partial should be focused on a single responsibility
  - Partials can be embedded in full pages via HTMX or directly with include
