Test cases for Django views in the public app.

These tests verify that views correctly handle HTTP requests,
render proper templates, provide appropriate context, and
handle form submissions correctly.

The following aspects are tested:
- Standard Django view functionality
- MainContentView base class
- HTMX-enabled views
- Session handling with SessionStateMixin
- Component context functions
