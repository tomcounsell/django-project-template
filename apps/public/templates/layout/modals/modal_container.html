  Modal Container
  ==============

  Purpose:
  Container for loading modal content via HTMX.
  Acts as a target for hx-target when loading modals.

  Usage:
  Include this in your base template, and target it with HTMX:
  <a href="/modals/example" hx-get hx-target="#modal-container">Show Modal</a>

  Multiple containers can be used for nested modals:
  - #modal-container: Primary modal container
  - #secondary-modal-container: For modals triggered from within a modal

  HTMX OOB Support:
  This component can receive content via OOB swaps.
