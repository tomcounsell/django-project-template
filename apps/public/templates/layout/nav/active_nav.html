  Active Navigation Component
  =========================
  
  Purpose:
  This is a server-side implementation for marking active navigation items.
  All logic is handled through context processors and template conditionals.
  
  Context Variables:
  - active_section: The current active section (e.g., 'home', 'teams', 'todos')
  
  Usage:
  The active_section is set automatically by the context processor based on the URL.
  
  HTMX OOB Support:
  This component is no longer needed for HTMX OOB updates, as the navigation state
  is rendered server-side. This file is kept as a placeholder for backward compatibility.
