# API App

## Purpose

The API app provides a RESTful API interface for the application, allowing programmatic access to data and functionality. It serves as the backend for mobile applications, third-party integrations, and client-side JavaScript applications.

## Features

### API Views

- **User Views**: Endpoints for user authentication and profile management
- **Image Views**: Endpoints for image upload and retrieval

### Serializers

- **User Serializer**: Converts User models to/from JSON

### Testing

- **APITestCase**: Base test case for API endpoints with assertion helpers

## Technical Approach

The API app is built on Django REST Framework and follows these principles:

1. **RESTful Design**: Resources are represented as URLs
2. **Authentication**: Token-based authentication
3. **Permissions**: Fine-grained permission control
4. **Serialization**: Conversion between Python objects and API formats
5. **Documentation**: API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger (to be implemented)

## Endpoints

- `/api/users/`: User management
- `/api/images/`: Image uploading and management

## Development Guidelines

- All API endpoints should have thorough tests
- Use standard REST conventions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement proper validation and error handling
- Document all endpoints with docstrings and OpenAPI
- Use custom permissions where needed
- Version the API when making breaking changes
