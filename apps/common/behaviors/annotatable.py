class Annotatable(models.Model):
    """
    A behavior mixin that allows models to have associated notes.
    
    This mixin provides a many-to-many relationship with the Note model,
    allowing any model to have multiple notes attached to it. This is useful
    for adding comments, annotations, or any additional information to objects.
    
    Attributes:
        notes (ManyToManyField): A many-to-many relationship with the Note model.
            Allows multiple notes to be associated with an instance of the model.
    
    Properties:
        has_notes (bool): Returns True if the object has any associated notes,
            False otherwise.
    
    Example:
        ```python
        class BlogPost(Annotatable, models.Model):
            title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
            content = models.TextField()
            
            # Can now use:
            # blog_post.notes.add(note)
            # blog_post.has_notes
        ```
    
    Note:
        This model is abstract and should be used as a mixin in other models.
