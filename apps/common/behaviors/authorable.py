class Authorable(models.Model):
    """
    author: User
    is_author_anonymous: bool
    authored_at: datetime

    A mixin for use with models that have an associated author, represented by a user.

    This mixin encapsulates common attributes related to authorship and can be used
    in various models that require an author attribute.

    Attributes:
        author (ForeignKey): A foreign key to the user model representing the author of the content.
            The related name is dynamically generated based on the class name.

        is_author_anonymous (bool): A boolean flag indicating whether the author's identity should
            be kept anonymous. Defaults to False.

        authored_at (datetime): A timestamp representing when the content was authored.
            Automatically set when the object is created.

    Properties:
        author_display_name (str): A property that returns the display name of the author.
            If `is_author_anonymous` is True, it returns "Anonymous"; otherwise, it returns the string representation of the author.

    Note:
        This model is abstract and should be used as a mixin in other models.
