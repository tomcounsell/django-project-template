class BackgroundJob(models.Model):
    """
    An abstract model for tracking the execution of background tasks or jobs.
    
    This model provides a foundation for monitoring asynchronous jobs, capturing their
    execution time, status, and any logs or errors that occur during processing.
    It's designed to be extended by specific job types.
    
    Attributes:
        name (str): The name or identifier of the job
        description (str): A detailed description of the job's purpose
        start_run_at (datetime): When the job started execution
        end_run_at (datetime): When the job completed execution
        has_errors (bool): Whether any errors occurred during execution
        is_failed (bool): Whether the job failed to complete successfully
        logs (JSONField): A collection of log entries generated during execution
    
    Properties:
        execution_time_humanized (str): A human-readable representation of the job's execution time
    
    Example:
        ```python
        class DataImportJob(BackgroundJob):
            source_file = models.FileField(upload_to='imports/')
            records_processed = models.IntegerField(default=0)
