    A model representing a city or urban area.

    This model stores information about cities, including their name,
    code (typically airport code), and country. It provides a standard
    way to reference locations at the city level throughout the application.

    Attributes:
        id (UUID): Unique identifier for the city
        name (str): The name of the city
        code (str): A short code for the city, typically the airport code
        country (ForeignKey): The country where this city is located

    Properties:
        currency (Currency): The currency used in this city, inherited from the country

    Note:
        The code field is automatically converted to lowercase before saving.

    Example:
        ```python
        san_francisco = City.objects.create(
            name="San Francisco",
            code="SFO",
