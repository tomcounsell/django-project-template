class Note(Timestampable, Authorable, models.Model):
    """
    A model representing a text note or comment.

    This model provides a versatile way to add notes to various entities through
    the Annotatable behavior. It includes author tracking via the Authorable behavior
    and timestamps via the Timestampable behavior.

    Attributes:
        id (UUID): Unique identifier for the note
        text (str): The content of the note
        author (ForeignKey): The user who created the note (from Authorable)
        is_author_anonymous (bool): Whether the author should remain anonymous (from Authorable)
        authored_at (datetime): When the note was created (from Authorable)
        created_at (datetime): When this note record was created (from Timestampable)
        modified_at (datetime): When this note record was last modified (from Timestampable)

    Example:
        ```python
        # Adding a note to an annotatable object
        note = Note.objects.create(
            text="This is an important comment",
            author=request.user
        )
        blog_post.notes.add(note)
        ```
