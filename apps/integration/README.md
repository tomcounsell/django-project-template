# Integration App

## Purpose

The Integration app handles connections to third-party services and platforms, providing a standardized way to interact with external APIs and services. It isolates integration code and provides clean interfaces for the rest of the application.

## Features

### Telegram Integration

- **Commands**: Command framework for telegram bot interactions
- **Telegram Client**: Interface with Telegram Bot API
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for Telegram messaging

### Slack Integration

- **Manifest**: Configuration for Slack app
- **API Client**: (To be implemented) Interface with Slack API

### Loops Integration

- **Client**: API client for Loops service
- **Shortcuts**: Helper functions for common Loops operations

## Technical Approach

The Integration app follows these principles:

1. **Service Isolation**: Each integration is isolated in its own module
2. **Configuration Management**: External configurations and credentials
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for external services
4. **Testability**: Mock interfaces for testing without external dependencies

## Usage Example (Telegram)

```python
from apps.integration.telegram import send_message

# Send message to a Telegram chat
send_message(chat_id="123456789", text="Hello from the application!")
```

## Development Guidelines

- Each integration should be in its own subdirectory
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Create mock services for testing
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Document API limitations and rate limits
