# AI App (Planned)

## Purpose

The AI app will manage all artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows in the application. It provides a standardized interface for integrating with AI services, storing AI-generated content, and managing AI-related user interactions.

> **Note**: This app is planned for future implementation according to the TODO list.

## Planned Features

### AI Service Integrations

- **OpenAI**: Integration with OpenAI APIs (GPT models, DALL-E, etc.)
- **Anthropic**: Integration with Claude and other Anthropic models
- **Hugging Face**: Access to open-source models via Hugging Face

### Content Generation

- **Text Generation**: Interfaces for generating text content
- **Image Generation**: Interfaces for generating image content
- **Content Enhancement**: Tools for improving existing content

### Agent Workflows

- **Conversational Agents**: Framework for building conversational AI agents
- **Task-specific Agents**: Specialized agents for particular domains
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Coordination between multiple AI agents

### Model Management

- **Prompt Templates**: Storage and versioning of prompts
- **Result Storage**: Database models for AI-generated content
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor API usage and costs

## Technical Approach

The AI app will follow these principles:

1. **Service Abstraction**: Unified interface across different AI providers
2. **Content Persistence**: Storage of prompts, context, and generated content
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking AI operations
4. **Caching**: Efficient use of API resources through caching
5. **Evaluation**: Tools for evaluating AI output quality

## Development Guidelines

- Abstract provider-specific details behind common interfaces
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Store context and results for auditability and debugging
- Create mock services for testing without API calls
- Manage costs through efficient prompt design and caching
